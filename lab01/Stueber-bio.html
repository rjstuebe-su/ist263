    My name is Roman Stueber. I am an Information Management and Technology major, with an interest in social media and data analytics. I am a team player and a very determined person. And I get to show these skills by being an ischool peer advisor and a brother of Kappa Thea Pi. Outside of work I love to spend time with my family and friends and winter ski, workout, and go water skiing. I also have 2 younger siblings to experience these things with.
