<h1> Changing the World one Student at a time</h1>

     <img src="proj-images/earth-2254769__480.jpg" alt="globe">

    <p>The time is now! Time for a change. Our Environment is changing and evolving in front our eyes but necessarily for the better. That’s why it is our time to take action and stop the earth from getting to a point of no return. </p>

    <p> I know you’ve all seen the Instagram stories and Facebook posts throwing meaningless statistics about climate change and helping our environment, but how do you act upon it? </p>

    <p> You’ve come to the right place! Here you can educate yourself about our Environment and be more aware of what is going on as well as find ways to help improve our planet. It is now up to us as a younger generation to save our planet</p>

<h2> What exactly is going on?</h2>

    <p> Just Because you do not directly see the changes of our planet collapsing it doesn’t mean they aren’t there. In developing countries almost 80% of their sewage is going untreated and ending up polluting their major water forms (lakes, rivers, and coasts). Thus, leaving an unusable water supply for them. A little closer to home almost 1 million seabirds die each year from Pollution in the U.S. along with 100,00 mammals in the water as well. And if that doesn’t make you take initiative hopefully this will.  </p>
  
    <p> Children are responsible for 10% of the pollution with almost 40% of the Environmental disease falling upon them. Meaning annually a little over 3million children die from Environmental Diseases. </p>
