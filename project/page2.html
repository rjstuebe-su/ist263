<h1> Ways to help!</h1>

<p> As college students we may feel helpless in this situation. But I am here to show and tell you that is not the case. Below is a video that will show you different things that you can implement in your own daily life to help make a change. Something as simple as using a metal straw can create huge impact. It is up to ourselves to save this planet. Saving the earth is not something that has to be such a daunting task. If everyone makes the effort to change little aspects about their life the planet would be such a better place. </p>
