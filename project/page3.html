<p> “What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror reflection of what we are doing to ourselves and to one another”.
    – Mahatma Gandhi</p>

    <h1> Why is it important?</h1>

    <p> Becoming educated about climate change, pollution, and environmental issues in general is the first step. Lets look at pollution in particular. Not only is pollution killing our planet and animals but it is also killing our race. Pollution is one of the biggest killers, affecting more than 100 million people worldwide. Even though pollution is a worldwide issue the United States is responsible for creating 30% of the worlds waste and uses 25%of the worlds natural resources. </p>
