<h1> Roman Stueber's Biography </h1>

<main>
<p> My name is Roman Stueber I am 20 years old and have flaming red hair. I was born into a family of 5 including myself, with a loving fluffly golden doodle. I am an Information Management and Technology major, with an interest in <strong> social media</strong> and data analytics. I am a team player and a very determined person. And I get to show these skills by being an ischool peer advisor and a brother of &Kappa; &Theta; &Pi;. Outside of work I love to spend time with my family and friends and winter ski, workout, and go water skiing. I also have 2 younger siblings to experience these things with. </p>
